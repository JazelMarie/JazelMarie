		<h2>Overview of the Subject</h2>
		<p style="font-family:tahoma;"><strong>Cloud computing</strong> is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet <strong>(“the cloud”)</strong> to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.</p>

	    <p style="font-family:tahoma;">These are the three main types of cloud computing services: <strong>Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platforms-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</strong>.
    <br>
    <br>
	    <strong>IaaS</strong> means a cloud service provider manages the infrastructure for you—the actual servers, network, virtualization, and data storage—through an internet connection.
    <br>
        <strong>PaaS</strong> means the hardware and an application-software platform are provided and managed by an outside cloud service provider, but the user handles the apps running on top of the platform and the data the app relies on.
    <br>
    <strong>SaaS</strong> is a service that delivers a software application—which the cloud service provider manages—to its users. Typically, SaaS apps are web applications or mobile apps that users can access via a web browser.
